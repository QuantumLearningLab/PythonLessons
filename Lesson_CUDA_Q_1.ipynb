We can use the notation $b=0$ to describe a bit $b$ in the state $0$. One way to visualize this is an arrow (or a unit vector).  If the vector is pointing up, the bit is in the state 0 and if the vector points down, the bit is in the state 1.  Classical computing can change the state of a bit by changing it from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa. This operation is known as a bit-flip, and visually looks like flipping the direction of the vector from up to down or vice versa.\n",

While a single bit can only be in one of 2 states at a given time, a single qubit can be in one of infinitely many states! This suggests that we might be able to handle information more efficiently with qubits than we could with bits.\n",

This is due to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Restricting our focus on how uncertainty arises in quantum computation, let's look at the general structure of a quantum program. Many quantum programs start with initializing a quantum state, manipulating the state, and then measuring it.  When we measure a qubit, the act of measuring can change the quantum state of the qubit. For example, measuring may collapse the quantum state of a single qubit to one of two classical states (e.g., 0 or 1). Measurement is how we extract useful information from a qubit. We'll explore this idea later in the notebook.\n",

As a generalization of bits, we'll identify the vector pointing up (i.e., in the direction of the positive $z$-axis) with the zero state (see figure below).\n",

In the cell block below, we have added the measurement explicitly with the `mz` command. There are other measurement options `mx` and `my` built into CUDA-Q that we'll experiment with in the next section. When we specify the measurement, instead of using the `cudaq.sample` execution mode, we switch to the `cudaq.run` execution mode.  To learn more about the differences between these execution modes, see the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/examples/executing_kernels.html).\n",

        "Notice that the results from running the two kernels above differ from one another.  And thus, by switching to measurement with the `mx` command we are able to distinguish the $\\ket{+}$ and $\\ket{-}$ states. However, there is a drawback &#8212; measuring with `mx` doesn't allow us to distinguish $\\ket{0}$ from $\\ket{1}$, because of the Uncertainty Principle in quantum mechanics. Test this claim out for yourself by creating and running kernels for the $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ states using the `mx` measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is happening when we take a measurement?  What distinguishes the `mz` command from the `mx` command?  Abstractly when we are measuring a state $\\ket{\\psi}=\\alpha\\ket{0}+\\beta\\ket{1}$ with `mz`, we are applying Born's rule to the state $\\ket{\\psi}$. This act of measurement will collapse the state to $\\ket{0}$, with a probability $|\\alpha|^2$  and will collapse the state of the qubit to  $\\ket{1}$ with probability $|\\beta|^2$. You can graphically visualize this collapse under a `mz` measurement on the Bloch sphere as projecting the state $\\ket{\\psi}$ onto the $z$ axis.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Analogously, when measuring with `mx` we will be collapsing our state $\\ket{\\psi}$ to either $\\ket{+}$ or $\\ket{-}$ along the $x$-axis of the Bloch sphere.  We can use Born's Rule for this measurement, too.  The only difference is now instead of writing $\\ket{\\psi}$ in terms of computational basis states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$, we'll find coefficients $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$ so that $\\ket{\\psi}=\\gamma\\ket{+}+\\delta\\ket{-}$. With the `mx`measurement, the probabilities of measuring a $0$ and $1$ are determined by $|\\gamma|^2$ and $|\\delta|^2$, respectively.\n",
        "So for the case of $\\ket{+}$, the probability of measuring $0$ with `mx` is $100\\%$, and for $\\ket{-}$ the probability of measuring a $1$ with `mx` is $100\\%$. Therefore, `mx` gives us a way to distinguish $\\ket{+}$ and $\\ket{-}$ with only one shot, assuming there is no noise.\n",
